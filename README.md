## Project Description:

This project revolves around leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to investigate historical loan applicant data within a consumer finance company. The primary objective is to identify patterns and influential factors that determine loan defaults. By analyzing customer attributes and loan characteristics, the aim is to uncover crucial indicators guiding the company's loan approval decisions. Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance risk assessment strategies, minimize credit losses, and optimize portfolio management by understanding the drivers behind loan defaults.

## General Information

### Project Background:
This project involves analyzing loan applicant data from a consumer finance company operating between 2007 and 2011.
### Business Problem:
The primary objective is to identify patterns within the dataset that can predict loan defaults. The aim is to help the company make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, minimizing the risk of defaults while maximizing profitable loan approvals.
### Dataset Used:
The dataset contains comprehensive loan data from 2007 to 2011, encompassing applicant profiles, loan attributes, and outcomes, such as Fully Paid, Current, and Charged-off (defaulted) loans.

## Conclusions
- Risk Indicators: Homeownership, income levels, DTI ratio, loan purpose, and borrower verification are crucial risk factors for loan defaults.
- Targeted Approach: Prioritize higher-income applicants and loans for specific purposes like weddings over small businesses to decrease default rates.
- Grade-Based Strategy: Focus on higher-grade applicants (e.g., "A" category) to improve business financial health and lower default rates.
- Geographic Focus: Target applicants from lower-risk states (NE, IN, ID) while being cautious of higher-risk states (TN, NV) to mitigate default probabilities.
- Risk Mitigation Practices: Implement strict applicant verification processes and offer shorter loan tenures to significantly reduce default risks.
